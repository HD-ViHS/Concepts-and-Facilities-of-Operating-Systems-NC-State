(a).
stat() returns information about the file located at a string pathname in a provided buffer,
while fstat() returns the same information in a buffer, but the file reference is a file-
descriptor int instead of a string pathname.

(b).
The flag O_NOFOLLOW can be used to force open() to fail if the pathname is a symbolic link.
This would prevent the type of attach described in the problem.

(c).
The ru_utime struct expresses the total amount of CPU time spent executing in user mode as a
timeval struct. The ru_stime struct expresses the total amount of CPU time spent executing in
kernel mode as a timeval struct.

(d).
If mq_receive returned because of an interrupt by a signal, then the errno of the return will
hold the value EINTR, the errno for a signal interruption.
