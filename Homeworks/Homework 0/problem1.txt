1a. The prescence of the O_CREAT flag specifies whether or not open() expects a third parameter rather than 2.
    The third parameter specifies what permissions are the user has to the created file.

1b. When read() reaches EOF, it returns 0 (read() read 0 bytes). When it encounters an error, it returns -1.
    So, a statement like if(read(...) == -1) would catch an error.

1c. It is possible for the fork() system call to fail because there are too many concurrent processes.
    The programmer can tell that this failure occured for this reason by observing that errno is set to
    EAGAIN.

1d. The wait() system call returns the process id of the process that triggered the end of the wait period.
    The programmer can use this return value to see which process ended the wait period.
